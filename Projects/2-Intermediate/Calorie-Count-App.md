#  App Idea: Calorie Count App

**Tier:** 2 - Intermediate

---

##  Description

The **Calorie Count App** allows users to calculate the total **calorie count** and other nutritional values (like **protein** and **natural sugar**) of a custom meal by selecting ingredients and quantities.

For example, if a user creates a **pizza** with ingredients such as *dough, mayo, sauce, carrot, onions, cheese*, the app will display the total calorie, protein, and sugar count for the entire meal.

---

##  Purpose of the Application

The purpose of this app is to help users:
- Track their calorie intake based on custom recipes or meals.
- Make healthier food choices by understanding nutritional breakdowns.
- Simplify fitness and diet tracking through ingredient-based analysis.

---

##  Resources Needed

- **Food Nutrition Database/API** (e.g., Edamam Food Database API, Nutritionix API)
- **Frontend framework** (React / Vue / Flutter for mobile)
- **Backend service** (Node.js / Firebase / Django)
- Optional: **Authentication service** (Firebase Auth or Auth0)

---

##  User Stories

- User can **input ingredients** manually or select them from a predefined list.  
- User can **enter the quantity** (in grams, cups, or servings) for each ingredient.  
- User can **view total calorie count** for the entire meal.  
- User can **view macronutrient breakdown** (protein, fat, carbs, sugar).  
- User can **save meals** for future reference.  
- User can **edit or remove ingredients** from a meal before calculating.

---

##  Bonus Features

- User can **scan barcodes** of packaged foods to automatically fetch nutrition data.  
- User can **log daily meals** and track total calories per day.  
- User can **set dietary goals** (e.g., calorie limit, protein target).  
- User can **generate reports or insights** on weekly eating patterns.  
- User can **share meals** with friends or nutrition coaches.

**Note:** This idea is distinct from the existing *Calorie Counter (Tier 3 – Advanced)* project in the repo.  
The existing idea focuses on transforming and searching a raw dataset (USDA MyPyramid) and optimizing large-dataset search.  
This *Calorie Count App* focuses on **ingredient-level meal construction** and **real-time aggregated nutrition** (user-oriented, not a dataset transformation challenge).
